This history file covers all modifications made to PRPNet Client/Server.

Verions 5.4.5:  February 15, 2021 - New Release
    prpserver:  Update CandidateGroupStats column SierpinskiRieselPrimeN immediately upon
                finding a prime to prevent tests for higher n from being sent to clients.

Version 5.4.4:  March 18, 2020 - New Release
    prpserver:  Add column to CandidateGroupStats to improve performance of "onekperinstance".
          all:  Update usage of PRIu64/PRId64/SCNu64/SCNd64 with printf/scanf to avoid
                compiler warnings.

Version 5.4.3:  December 19, 2016 - New Release
    prpserver:  Change candidate selection to address issues with finding doublecheck work.
	             Show default sortsequence in prpserver.ini for configurations that do not
				    allow a change to that configuration.

Version 5.4.2:  September 11, 2016 - New Release
          all:  Add support for Multifactorial searhes.
	
Version 5.4.1:  December 29, 2015 - New Release
          all:  Add support for Carol/Kynea searches, (k*b^n+/-1)^2-12.
	
Version 5.4.0:  January 31, 2015 - New Release
          all:  Add support for generic searches (pfgw only).
                Add support for cyclotomic searches.  The cyclotomic form is Phi(k,b^n}.
                if k=3 and n=2^N for some integer N, cyclo will be used (if configured 
                on the client) as it can more quickly test that form on a GPU.  For
                other values of k and n, pfgw will be used.  Stats will be rolled up by
                k and n.
                Fixed VS2012 solution warnings.  The Windows clients are now suffixed
                with "64" or "32" for 64-bit and 32-bit.
    prpserver:  Remove support for clients older than 5.1.
    prpclient:  By default client will use LLR over PFGW if applicable for the candidate
                being tested.  This is because LLR is faster than PFGW for most tests.
                With the change the client will now ignore what the server sends for
                that flag.  If you don't want to use LLR, then comment it out in the
                prpclient.ini file.
                Remove support for servers older than 5.1.

                
Version 5.3.2:  July 10, 2014 - Patch Release
          all:  Add support for x^y+y^x and x^y-y^x searches.
    prpserver:  Fix an issue with double-checks.
    

Version 5.3.1:  May 2, 2014 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Fix crash when processing wwww work units.
                Fix issue where last character of LLR residue was truncated
                before it was reported.
                Fix uninitialized variable in the client.
    prpserver:  Fix an issue with length calculation of candidates.
    

Version 5.3.0:  September 19, 2013 - New Release
          all:  Cleaned up compiler warnings with sockets.
                Use PRId64/PRIu64 where needed.
                Convert to using the string datatype for most function parameters.
    prpserver:  Added notifylowwork= option to the prpserver.ini.  When set to a
                non-zero value, the server will send an e-mail once a day notifying
                the distribution list that the server is running low on work.
                This change triggered the refactoring of some server code,
                specifically the moving of logic from prpserver.cpp to helper
                classes specific to the server type.
                Reject results from genefer programs with version "3.2.0beta-0".
                Fixed issue with determining if a machine or user could double-check.
    prpclient:  Added version reporting for genefer apps.
                Reject genefer programs with version "3.2.0beta-0".
                

Version 5.2.8:  August 29, 2013 - Patch Release
          all:  Fixed a logging issue that prevented debug logging from working
                as intended.
    prpclient:  Add support for OpenCL based genefer.  It will be treated as if
                it is equivalent to the CUDA version of genefer.
    prpserver:  Fix log issue where prpserver.log would sometimes duplicate a line
                written to it.
                Ensure database transaction is using REPEATABLE READ option.
                Check return codes when setting connection attributes in database.
                Add support for OpenCL based genefer.  It will be treated as if
                it is equivalent to the CUDA version of genefer.
                Fixed an issue with loading Cullen-Woodall candidates that prevented
                loading of multiple bases.


Version 5.2.7:  July 29, 2013 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  Fix bug introduced with 5.2.6.
  

Version 5.2.6:  June 24, 2013 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  If client returns a residue with '.', remove it.
                Add localtimezone=2 setting to disable appending timestamp in the
                log with a timezone.
    prpclient:  Fixed issue where '.' wasn't removed from residue when using llr.


Version 5.2.5:  June 12, 2013 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  For Wall-Sun-Sun, reject results from wwwwcl prior to version 2.2.5.
                Add noexpire=1 option to inhibit task expiration.
                Add nonewwork=1 option to disable new work from be sent to clients.
                Add keys to tables to improve efficiency with larger databases.
                Multiple WWWW bug fixes.
                

Version 5.2.4:  April 19, 2013 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  Update SharedMemoryitem to simplify use of mutexes.
                Fix ^C on server so that it waits for client connections to close
                instead of immediately closing.
                Fix computation of remaining days as it was dividing by 84400
                seconds per day, not 86400.
                If localtimelog is set to 2, then don't print timezone in log.
    prpadmin:   Fix loading of candidate from ABC.  Although it worked before, it
                would sometimes give an erroneous messge.


Version 5.2.3:  January 7, 2013 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  If client detects an error when starting up, show the error, then
                sleep for 10 seconds so that user can see the error.  This addresses
                an issue for users who double-click on the application but the window
                closes immediately due to a configuration error.
    prpserver:  Fixed *nix compile bug with the server.
                Added serverstatssummaryonly= option to prpserver.ini.  When set to 1
                the server will only show the summary line on server_stats.html.
                Add sorting capability to a number of html tables.
                Refactored much of the HTML generation code.
                Fix crash when database connection is closed.


Version 5.2.2:  December 18, 2012 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  Change onekperclient to onekperinstance and fix a bug related to it
                that was created in 5.2.0.
          all:  Fix logging issue where timezone would show as '???'.
                Added 64-bit build options for Windows.


Version 5.2.1:  November 26, 2012 - Patch Release
          all:  Fix a problem splitting messages read from socket as code was using strcpy
                where both source and target were in same string buffer.  Apparently some
                flavors of Linux do not like that.
                Upgrade Visual Studio solution for VS2010.


Version 5.2.0:  November 1, 2012 - New Release
    prpclient:  Replace clientid in ini with machineid and instanceid.
                Fix bug for wwww projects where client couldn't extract program name.
    prpserver:  Rename column ClientID in database to MachineID.  Add InstanceID.
                Modify doublechecker to use machine id instead of clientid.
                Fix bug in Sierpinski/Riesel stats to ensure prime listed in table
                has the smallest n.
                Modify Sierpinski/Riesel stats updater to set HasSierpinskiRieselPrime
                flag on new Candidates that are inserted if a prime was already found
                for the k, b, c.
                Removed support for clients older than 4.3.
                Added brieftestlog to prpserver.ini.  This flag can be used to shorten
                the output on consoles.
                Added estimate of days left to Wieferich/WallSunSun server_stats.html.

  Note:  If migrating from PRPNet 5.x, you must run this SQL on the database to rename the
         ClientID column and to add the InstanceID column before starting the server.

    alter table UserWWWWs change column ClientID MachineID varchar(200) collate latin1_bin;
    alter table UserWWWWs add column InstanceID varchar(200) collate latin1_bin;
    alter table UserPrimes change column ClientID MachineID varchar(200) collate latin1_bin;
    alter table UserPrimes add column InstanceID varchar(200) collate latin1_bin;
    alter table CandidateTest change column ClientID MachineID varchar(200) collate latin1_bin;
    alter table CandidateTest add column InstanceID varchar(200) collate latin1_bin;
    alter table CandidateGFNDivisor change column ClientID MachineID varchar(200) collate latin1_bin;
    alter table CandidateGFNDivisor add column InstanceID varchar(200) collate latin1_bin;
    alter table WWWWRangeTest change column ClientID MachineID varchar(200) collate latin1_bin;
    alter table WWWWRangeTest add column InstanceID varchar(200) collate latin1_bin;
    
    update UserWWWWs set InstanceID = MachineID;
    update UserPrimes set InstanceID = MachineID;
    update CandidateTest set InstanceID = MachineID;
    update CandidateGFNDivisor set InstanceID = MachineID;
    update WWWWRangeTest set InstanceID = MachineID;


Version 5.1.0:  September 5, 2012 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  Fixed debug message.
    prpclient:  Allow only one instance of a client to run at a time from the directory.


Version 5.0.9:  May 26, 2012 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  Verify client is using correct helper programs for PRPing projects.


Version 5.0.8:  May 12, 2012 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  Added support for wwwwcl helper program.
                Use coalesce() for PostgreSQL database and ifnull() for MySQL.
    prpclient:  Added support for wwwwcl helper program.


Version 5.0.7:  March 2012 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Since primality tests take a long time for primorials/factorials,
                and as the pfgw doesn't checkpoint primality tests, the client
                will no longer do them for numbers of those forms.
                If the ini file was modified to remove all servers and the client
                has completed all tests and returned them, then shut down.


Version 5.0.6:  February 2012 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Fix bug that prevents 5.x clients from working with 4.0.x servers.


Version 5.0.5:  January 2012 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Fix bug (introduced in 5.0) that causes client to send Twin and SG
                workunits back to the server even though the client didn't have to do
                the test for them.
                Fix bug that allows users to not specify any servers in the ini file.
                Change "genefercuda-boinc" to "genefercuda" as they are technically the
                same program and the server doesn't recognize "genefercuda-boinc".


Version 5.0.4:  January 2012 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Fix crash in client when wwww near miss is found.


Version 5.0.3:  January 2012 - Patch Release
          all:  Fix potential crashes found thanks to gcc compiler warnings.
    prpclient:  Log wwww results and near misses to test_results.log.
                Added startoption/stopoption 7, to complete all work then shut
                down without reporting completed work.
                Normalize work percentage for each configured server if total
                percentage != 100.
    prpserver:  Order by descending total score on Team and User stats HTML pages.
                Add ability to sort by clicking on a column on user and team
                stats pages.  This is done through prpserver.ini configuration.


Version 5.0.2:  December 2011 - Patch Release
     prpadmin:  Added option 10, which allows admins to expire workunits manually.
    prpclient:  When connecting to a 5.0.2 server and above, don't send acknowledgement
                that workunit has been received.
    prpserver:  When connected to a 5.0.2 client and above, don't expect acknowledgement.
                Added support or admin expire option.
                When logging SQL statements, substitute bound values for '?' in logs.

    Note:  In this release I reverted the change from 4.3.0 that required the server to get
           an acknowledgement from the client before reserving the workunit.  Although this
           prevented the server from having workunits that no client was working on, it caused
           a worse problem where clients would work on something, then report back to the server
           only to have the server reject the work because it hadn't received the initial
           acknowledgement.  By adding the "expire" option to prpadmin, this alleviates the
           problem of lost workunits on the server that have to wait for the time to expire
           them.  Obviously manual intervention is still required, but it is an improvement
           over how it was handled previously.


Version 5.0.1:  December 2011 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  Fix bug that prevented some clients from returning completed workunits.
                Use same e value for all numbers on stats pages for a given project.
              


Version 5.0.0:  December 2011 - New Release
          all:  Added support for Wieferich, Wolstenholme, Wilson and Wall-Sun-Sun
                searches (note that wwww client only handles Wieferich and Wall-Sun-Sun
                at this time).
    prpclient:  For GFN searches, do not do primality test for n >= 262144 because
                PFGW requires many days to do the test and it doesn't checkpoint.
    prpserver:  Added localtimehtml= to prpserver.ini
                Renamed localtime= to localtimelog= in prpserver.ini
                On server_stats.html page, groups with no remaining candidates to
                be tested will have a background color of aqua.
                On Sierpinski/Riesel server stats, display a summary table if multiple
                conjectures are loaded into the server.

  There is no database upgrade script from 4.3.x to 5.0.  New tables and columns are only
  referenced by servers configured for wwww searches.


Version 4.3.7:  November 2011 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Fix bug when loading GFN divisors from save file upon startup.
                When getting work from multiple servers, get work from each server
                before trying to balance work across all servers.


Version 4.3.6:  November 2011 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Fix bug where client is unable to extract PRP test time when using genefer.
    prpserver:  Add links to other web pages for the project to top of every page.
                For HTML generation, evaluate if GFN divisibility checks can
                be done and make user_gfns.html available only if true.
                For HTML generation, make team HTML pages available only if
                there are any teams are running against the server.  This
                is re-evaluated every 10 minutes.
                Added estimate for the number of days left of work in the server.  This
                works best if all workunits require similar test times.


Version 4.3.5:  June 2011 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  Added onekperclient option.  This is used with Sierpinski/Riesel
                server to ensure that each k goes to one and only one client at
                a time.  This should be used when there are many more k values
                to be tested than clients.
                Fixed a bug with work selection that would prevent the server
                from returning work if it exhausted its cursor of 100 records
                before finding an appropriate workunit to send.
    prpclient:  Fixed bug where client would delete genefer checkpoint file
                upon restart.
                Fixed bug with GFN testing where client would report that it
                completed when it hadn't.


Version 4.3.4:  June 2011 - Patch Release
          all:  Modify loglimit in ini files to by in megabytes, not bytes.
    prpserver:  Added information to pending_tests.html that tells how long
                before a test will expire.
    prpclient:  Correctly fix bug when using startoption=3.
   

Version 4.3.3:  May 2011 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  Now supports dsn based ODBC connections.
                Added version of create_tables script that works on PostgreSQL.
    prpclient:  Fix bug when using startoption=3.


Version 4.3.2:  April 2011 - Patch Release
     prpadmin:  Fix a problem that occurs when ABC file has less than 101 entries.
    prpserver:  Fixed candidate loading of GFNs (wasn't fixed correctly in 4.3.1).
                Fixed work selection issue with GFNs.
                Fixed server stats computation issues with GFNs. 


Version 4.3.1:  April 2011 - Patch Release
          all:  Change socket debug messages so that different types of sockets could
                log different information.
    prpclient:  Fix crash when logging debug messages
    prpserver:  Fix stats computation on GFN servertype.
                Fix candidate loading of GFNs, primorials, and factorials.


Version 4.3.0:  March 2011 - New Release
    prpadmin:   Ignore ERR messages when sending ABC files and factor files to the server.
    prpclient:  If starting client and all work is done, return it immediately so that 
                client can get more work rather than sleeping due to error timeout.
                Changed protocol when getting work to ensure that server knows that
                client has received it.
    prpserver:  Move static variable to instance variable to avoid SQL_INVALID_HANDLE
                when loading candidates.
                Fixed bug in HTML generation of team_primes.html.
                Changed protocol when getting work to ensure that server knows that
                client has received it.


Version 4.2.3:  March 2011 - Patch release
    prpclient:  Fix bug (created in 4.2.2) where client would sleep, but then not try to
                connect to any servers.
    prpserver:  Fix function sequence error bug when inserting new candidates.
                Fix bug where first candidate inserted would have no name.


Version 4.2.2:  March 2011 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Add more logging for debuglevel=3..
                Fix bug where client would not return completed work because it thought that
                the work was still in progress.
                Fix bug where client would not sleep for designated amount of time if unable
                to connect to any servers.


Version 4.2.1:  February 2011 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Do not attempt primality test if c != 1/-1.  Just return PRP to the server.
                Ensure genefer.ckpt is deleted, except in case when ^C was used to stop the client.
                After returning work to the server, if there are no more workunits to be returned
                to any servers, then the client will re-read the ini file to get the current
                server confugations.  Any changes made to server configuration, whether it be
                percentage, number of entries, etc. will result in the client resetting all 
                counters WRT work percentages.  Note that if changes were made and not done
                correctly, that the client can shut down.
                Minor change to start options (option 5 is now option 9).
                Added new stop options.
                Added stop ASAP options (to shutdown between tests).
                When ^C is hit, re-read the ini file to get the current stopoption.
                Before starting another test, re-read ini file to get updated debuglevel.
                Added server suffix to test_results.log.
    prpserver:  Modified so that "Leading Edge" on the server_stats.html page shows the lowest
                value, i.e. the next value to be sent by the server.
                Once every 256 seconds, re-read ini file to get updated debuglevel.
                Add CSS support to generated HTML.


Version 4.2.0:  February 2011 - New Release
    prpclient:  Added new startoptions.  Read prpclient.ini for more information.
                Use llrpi to prove primality on k*b^n+/-1 numbers if phrot is
                used for the PRP test.  Note that phrot should only be needed on
                non-x86 hardware.
    prpserver:  Fix computation of decimal lengths of primorials.
                Changed Twin server type to be fixed b/n/c with variable k rather
                than fixed b/k/c with variable n.
                Rewrote all SQL to use bound variables.  This will allow user,
                client, and team names to have characters such as a single quote in
                them.
                Added userteam_stats.html and teamuser_stats.html.
                Added support for c != 1 for all forms except Sophie-Germain.

                Run this script to create a new database tables:

Version 4.1.4:  January 2011 - Patch Release
     prpserver: Fix issue with bad team IDs because variable wasn't initialized.

                
Version 4.1.3:  January 2011 - Patch Release
     prpclient: Fix program name sent to the server for GFN tests. 
                Fix issue where client loses track of workunits when it hasn't had
                confirmation from the server that they were accepted.


Version 4.1.2:  January 2011 - Patch Release
     prpclient: Fix issue with deleting genefer checkpoint. Added check to handle
                condition of running a different version of genefer than previous
                checkpoint.
                Support GPU affinity for genefercuda.
                Exit correctly if ^C when running genefer.
     prpserver: Fix HTML when TeamID is null.
                Fixed decimal length calculation for primorials.


Version 4.1.1:  January 2011 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Support GPU affinity for genefercuda.
    prpserver:  Fix HTML when TeamID is null.


Version 4.1.0:  December 2010 - New Release
    prpclient:  Added teamid= option to the prpclient.ini file.  This allows the client to
                do tests on behalf of a team.
                Added support for "genefer_cuda" version of genefer.
    prpserver:  Added support for "genefer_cuda" version of genefer.
                Added support for the team reported by a client.  A team ID is captured
                for each test, thus it is possible for clients (and users) to have some
                tests for one team and other tests for another team.
                Added team_stats.html and team_primes.html.
                Added "Team" column to user_stats.html, user_primes.html, and pending_tests.html.
                Fixed an issue with inserting GFNs as the value for column c was not set.
                
                Run this script to update your database tables:

         TeamID                  varchar(200)   collate latin1_bin,
         TestsPerformed          int,

         TotalScore              double,
         primary key (TeamID)
      ) ENGINE=InnoDB;


Version 4.0.6:  December 2010 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  Removed experimental code that caused server to keep database connections 
                open.


Version 4.0.5:  December 2010 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  Made a few changes to eliminate some complaints from valgrind.
                On *nix, detach threads after creating them as they cause the server
                to use large amounts of virtual memory.
                Fix bug so that server respects log limits.
                Exit if unable to lock mutex.
                Add "if exists" to "drop table" in create tables script.
    prpclient:  Removed iodbc from client link.
                Fix bug so that client respects log limits.


Version 4.0.4:  December 2010 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Fixed and issue using genefer as client due to variable not being set.


Version 4.0.3:  November 2010 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Fixed issue when using genefer as client would sometimes not do any testing
                with it, even when available.


Version 4.0.2:  November 2010 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Verify that INFO message from server is for the specific candidate
                before treating it as accepted by the server.
                Do not sent sub-workunits that have not had a test done.
                The client will remove a workunit from its list only if the server
                responds with an INFO message for that workunit.
                If the client gets an error when reporting a workunit to a server,
                it will close the socket and try again later rather than trying to
                send any additional workunits.
                Fix parsing of GFN factors as client excluded first character of
                string sent back to the server.
    prpserver:  Fix problems with loading candidates for Sophie-Germain servers.
                On pending_tests.html, add CandidateName to the sorting.
                Fixed a memory leak when sending mail.
                Made a change to eliminate the "Error in my_thread_global_end(): 1 threads didn't exit"
                message from MySQL.  In doing so, the server will always have at least one active
                connection to the MySQL server.
                Return "test accepted" message if the test has already been marked as
                completed.  This can occur if the client didn't receive the INFO message
                the first time it sent the test and eliminates potential confusion that
                the test was rejected.


Version 4.0.1:  October 2010 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Fixed an issue introduced in 4.0.0 with Primorial/Factorial searches.
    prpserver:  Add time zone to date of mail so that time shows up in the correct time zone
                in mail in-boxes.
                Populate new TestResult column on UserPrimes and fix SQL behind the view to use it.
                Do not send e-mail if SMTP authentication needed and password not supplied.


Version 4.0.0:  October 2010 - New Release
          all:  Added support for Sophie/Germain prime searches.
                Fixed many compiler warnings on *nix.
                Stripped "<candidate> is a Factor of" from GFN divisors.
    prpclient:  Much of this has been rewritten to support Sophie/Germain and other prime
                searches, such as Cunningham chains and Arithmethic Progressinos(which has
                yet to be written).  One result of this is that the client will log more
                messages for certain server types.
                Added support for usellroverpfgw setting from server.  When set, the
                client will use LLR instead of PFGW for primality tests.
                Always check for GFN divisiblity when b = 2 and c = 1.  This could happen
                for Twin and Sophie-Germain prime searches.
                Return version of helper program used by the client.
                Fixed an issue where the client would think that the server accepted a
                workunit when it didn't.
    prpserver:  As part of the Sophie-Germain prime search, the server will now log additional
                messages for that server type.
                Fixed a stats issue with "Completed Thru" on the GFN server stats webpage.
                Reworked e-mail messages to be a little more readable.
                Added user_gfns.html webpage for GFN divisors by user.
                Added projectname= to prpserver.ini for the Prime Pages project name.
                Added usellroverpfgw= option to prpserver.ini.
                Modified sortoption= in prpserver.ini to provide maximum flexibility.
                Show if candidate was prime or PRP on user_primes.html.
                Significantly improved speed loading of Candidates via prpadmin.
                On Sierpinski/Riesel stats page, do not include k with a PRP/prime when
                determining the "Completed Thru" column.
                Added new columns for tracking the version the helper programs used by the
                client.
                Fixed a memory leak due to not releasing the database connection handle.

                With the changes for this release, you will need to run the upgrade_3.3_to_3.4.sql
                script in the source directory to bring the database up to date.  Because there
                are signficant changes in this release, it is HIGHLY recommend to do a backup
                before executing that script.



Version 3.3.6:  August 2010 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  Add localtime= to prpserver.ini.  By default it is set to 1 which
                will log everything in the local time zone of the server.  By
                setting to 0, the server will log using the GMT time zone.


Version 3.3.5:  July 2010 - Patch Release
          all:  Display correct time zone in logs.


Version 3.3.4:  July 2010 - Patch Release
          all:  Use local time instead of GMT in logs.
    prpserver:  Fix sending of e-mail for found primes.  This was broken in 3.3.0.
                Fix issue where log file sometimes does not display date of message.


Version 3.3.3:  July 2010 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  The fix for 3.3.2 for clients connecting to the server was done
                incorrectly.  It was fixed correctly in this release.


Version 3.3.2:  June 2010 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Fixed crash that occurs when client cannot connect to the server.
                Fixed behavioral issue when starting client so that it can continue
                to work on other servers if unable to return work.
                

Version 3.3.1:  June 2010 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  Added CountInProgress column to create_tables.sql script.
                Change summary lines on Sierpinski/Riesel HTML to bold text.


Version 3.3.0:  May 2010 - New Release
          all:  Code infrastructure changes WRT sockets.  The Socket class was
                cumbersome.  I changed it so that Socket is an ancestor class and
                that specific server/client/mail functionality would be in descendent
                classes.
                Buffer no more than 4000 bytes at a time before sending data across
                the socket.  This should improve performance on large data transfers.
                Use a static buffer for receiving data from a socket.
                Use a static buffer when logging messages.
    prpclient;  Fixed an issue when testing for twin primes.
                When the startoption is to report and abort, shut down the client
                immediately after communicating with the server.
    prpserver:  Added maxclients= to prpserver.ini to limit how many concurrent
                clients the server will handle.
                Removed -u option for upgrading from version 2.x.
                Removed behavior to insert into UserPrimes at startup since
                nobody (that I know of) is using a version of 3.x that is pre-3.2.
                Renamed ClientThread.cpp to HelperThread.cpp.
                Changed threading architecture to address memory allocation issue.
                Do not set LastUpdateTime when a test is sent to a client.
                When sorting by LastUpdateTime, include DecimalLength as an
                additional criteria in case multiple rows have the same LastUpdateTime.
                Moved logic from ClientHandler.cpp to HelperThread.cpp.
                Added CompletedThru to group stats.
                Added CountInProgress to group stats.
                Added summary line to group stats.
                Added a new index to Candidate to improve performance.
                Fixed an issue with BIGINT datatypes.  With this change a number
                of columns have been changed from varchar(20) to bigint.
                
                Run this script in mysql to apply all database changes for this release:

      alter table Candidate modify k bigint;
      alter table Candidate modify LastUpdateTime bigint;
      alter table CandidateTest modify TestID bigint;
      alter table CandidateGroupStats modify k bigint default 0;
      alter table CandidateGroupStats modify MinInGroup bigint default 0;
      alter table CandidateGroupStats modify MaxInGroup bigint default 0;
      alter table CandidateGroupStats modify LeadingEdge bigint default 0;
      alter table CandidateGroupStats add CompletedThru bigint default 0;
      alter table CandidateGroupStats add CountInProgress int default 0;
      alter table UserPrimes modify DateReported bigint;
      alter table Candidate add index ix_bnck (b, n, c, k);



Version 3.2.5:  April 2010 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Fix loop that occurs when doing work for a Sierpinski/Riesel
                server if a prime/PRP is found.
    prpserver:  Fixed a crash that can occur if unable to connect to SMTP
                server.

                
Version 3.2.4:  April 2010 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Skip workunits on Sierpinski/Riesel type servers on matching
                k/b/c with higher n if a prime/PRP is found.
                Use -gxo instead of -gx when searching for GFN divisors since
                primality test has already been done.
                This release of PRPNet requires PFGW 3.2.4 if used on any 
                projects that can test for GFN divisibility.  PFGW 3.2.4 outputs
                a string that the client requires before it can tell the server
                that it has successfully tested for GFN divisors.
    prpserver:  Added code for loading GFNs from an ABC file.  Somehow I had
                overlooked it.
                Added abcformats.txt to describe supported ABC formats.
                If unhideprimehours is set to 0, show primes immediately on
                user_primes.html page.
                Have server send out tests for lower n on Sierpinski/Riesel
                servers even if a prime/PRP is found for a higher n.
                If a Sierpinski/Riesel prime is found, then do not count
                candidates with a higher n against the "untested candidates"
                count on the server stats page.
                Fixed an issue that prevented double checks from being correctly
                updated in the database.
                Fixed e-mail message for Proth numbers to state that client
                searched for GFN divisors, but did not find any instead of saying
                that search wasn't done.
                Fixed console output issue when PRP is found.
                Fixed server_stats.html for FixedBNC servers.
                Modified columns on CandidateGroupStats to work with FixedBNC
                servers.  Use the following statements to modify the columns:
                
                alter table CandidateGroupStats modify MinInGroup varchar(20);
                alter table CandidateGroupStats modify MaxInGroup varchar(20);
                alter table CandidateGroupStats modify LeadingEdge varchar(20);


Version 3.2.3:  March 2010 - Patch Release
          all:  Fixed a crash that can occur if the socket connection is
                lost when sending data across it.
    prpserver:  Fixed SQL so that GFN divisors are inserted into the database.
                Fixed two issues that could lead to the server looping when a
                client requests work.
                Added new debug messages when fetching from a cursor.
                Change format of messages in completed_tests.log to match
                formatting from 3.2.0.
                Added sortoption=A, sorting by oldest candidate.

Version 3.2.2:  March 2010 - Patch Release
          all:  Added client socket ID to all log messages so that it is easier
                to track connection traffic.
    prpclient:  Fixed bug where base 2 tests were using PFGW instead of LLR/phrot.
    prpserver:  Use server_stats.html as the default webpage.
                Fix prime/PRP counts on server stats webpage.
                Fixed SELECT statement for FixedKBC servers when updating group stats.
                Sync group stats about three times per hour rather than whenever
                a completed test is sent, unless a prime/PRP is returned.
                Modified main work sender loop to retrieve fewer records, but to
                be re-iterated multiple times until enough work is sent or until
                there are no more records returned by the cursor.
                Added a new index to CandidateTest to be added through MySQL with
                the following command:
                
                alter table CandidateTest add index ix_residue (CandidateName, Residue);

Version 3.2.1:  February 2010 - Patch Release
          all:  Added memory leak detection logic (Windows only) and fixed
                numerous memory leaks.
                Changed sockets to include TCP_NODELAY setting.
                Fixed a number of memory leaks.
                Changed "char *fmt" to "const char *fmt" to eliminate a
                number of compiler warnings.
    prpclient:  Accept "keepalive" message from server when getting work.
                Modify so that client can connect to a server that needs
                a non-blocking or blocking socket.
    prpserver:  Fixed two crashes, one with webpage generation and one with
                unhiding primes.
                Fixed an issue with the display of Fixed K/B/C server stats.
                Send "keepalive" to client when opening work work cursor
                so that client doesn't time out.
                Fixed ordering of k on server_stats.html.
                Added all.html as the default webpage.

Version 3.2.0:  February 2010 - New Release
          all:  Fixed an issue on Linux builds with an uninitialized mutex
                causing the software to crash.
    prpclient:  Added "echotest" option to prpclient.ini.  Setting this to 0
                will tell the client not to echo "INFO" messages to the console
                for accepted tests.
                Fixed a bug when using the client to test GFNs.  When a roundoff
                error would occur, the client would neglect to delete temporary
                files generated.  The next version of genefer would run, but 
                read the same roundoff error instead of the actual test result.
                Modified client to wait up to 60 seconds to get a response from
                the server.
    prpserver:  Added "echotest" option to prpserver.ini.  Setting this to 0
                will tell the server not to echo "Test sent" and "Test received"
                messages to the console.
                Changed HTML format of Sierpinski/Riesel server_stats.html to
                create a separate table for each base along with a header and
                summary row for the base.  The summary row will now be shown in
                red if all k have a prime or PRP.
                Added UserPrimes table, which is populated upon server start
                up if the table is empty.  If the server fails to load the
                table, then it will not run until the problem is fixed.
                Added user_primes.html to show all primes found, grouped by user.
                Added unhideprimehours= to prpserver.ini.  This is used to control
                how long a prime/PRP is hidden from user_primes.html before it
                can be viewed by the public.
                Added server version to HTML title on webpages.
                Replaced "Other k/n/b/c" with "Fixed b/n/c" in prpserver.ini.  This
                changes the grouping and sorting of server stats.
                Limit size of result set on server when getting work because loading
                large numbers (100000 or more) into memory when opening the cursor
                can lead to the client timing out.
                Changes locking mechanism when getting work since MySQL does not
                seem to always respect "for update" on InnoDB database.
                Added socket to logs to aid in trouble-shooting.
                Changed LengthCalculator to select blocks of records at a time
                so that it is less likely to timeout the admin tool.

Version 3.1.5:  January 2010 - Patch Release
          all:  Changed logging so that debug.log data is written to 
                prpserver.log/prpclient.log depending upon debuglevel. This was
                done to make it easier to find debug information when enabled
                instead of having to look through multiple files.
    prpclient:  Write all results to test_results.log instead of helper program
                specific log files.
    prpserver:  Use mutex to guarantee that only one thread can update the
                database at a time when getting work.

Version 3.1.4:  January 2010 - Patch Release
          all:  Changed socket behavior to use Sleep() before select()
                because select() does not relinquish control of the CPU.
    prpclient:  Add GFN support for phrot.
                Use -e with PFGW on primality proofs to increase likelihood
                that it can get to 33% factorization, which is necessary for
                the proof.

Version 3.1.3:  January 2010 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Fix crash with getting time of LLR test no 64-bit Linux.
                Fix bug where the client did not part LLR time correctly and
                would return 0.
     prpadmin:  Buffer 100 candidates/factors at a time instead of 1000 to
                hopefully address Linux issues with large buffers and sockets.

Version 3.1.2:  January 2010 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  Lock Candidate record to prevent two different clients from
                getting test for the same candidate at a time.
                Change database engine to InnoDB because it supports record
                level locking, which is necessary for PRPNet.  It also improves
                performance significantly.
                Flush printf() output from admin process.
     prpadmin:  Flush printf() output from server.

Version 3.1.1:  January 2010 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  Fix bug with handling factors from admin tool.

Version 3.1.0:  January 2010 - New Release
    prpserver:  Send a single INFO or ERROR message for each workunit instead of
                an acknowledgement and then immediately commit/rollback the
                transaction in the database.  This will significantly reduce the
                possibility of one happening without the other.
                The "End of WorkUnit" message must now specify the CandidateName
                and TestID for the workunit that it references.
                Add SecondsForTest to CandidateTest table.
                In theory this server is backward compatible with previous versions
                of the clients, but has not been tested. 
    prpclient:  Add CandidateName and TestID to the "End of WorkUnit" message to
                that the server matches the begin and end of the message for that
                workunit.  Without it, the server might record the test results
                against the wrong candidate.
                Instead of sending all workunits then waiting for a response,
                send them one at at time and wait for the server to send an INFO or
                ERROR message before sending the next one.
                The client now sends the number of seconds for the PRP test back
                to the server.
                In theory this client is backward compatible with previous versions
                of the server, but has not been tested.                

Version 3.0.1:  January 2010 - Patch Release
          all:  Fixed issue with large buffered messages to avoid memory leak.
     prpadmin:  Send 1000 entries at a time to the server and wait for a response
                before continuing.  This has been done to prevent the admin tool
                from flooding the server's socket, thus preventing new clients
                from connecting.
    prpserver:  Send positive confirmation to prpadmin after every 1000 entries
                has been processed so that the admin tool can continue.
                The server can now hand out candidates by n.  Check out
                sortoption= in the prpserver.ini file.
                Send greeting as part of GETWORK message.  GETGREETING is no
                longer supported.
                Changed CandidateGroupStats table column names and meanings, thus
                affecting server_stats.html.  If upgrading from 3.0.0, this table
                must be dropped and recreated and repopulated.  It can be repopulated
                through the admin tool.
                Changed servertype FixedKBNC to FixedBKC.
                Changed servertype OtherKBNC to FixedBNC.
                Close SQL cursor so successive updates are executed.  This caused
                multiple issues where database updates would not be synchronized.
    prpclient:  New logic to handle greeting from the server.
                When using PFGW, do not create ABC file, just write candidate
                to input as it will reduce the amount of output generated by PFGW.

Version 3.0.0:  January 2010 - New Release
     prpadmin:  Buffer factors and candidates from ABC files to reduce the
                number of send/receive requests on the socket.
    prpserver:  The server now runs with a MySQL database instead of the
                prpserver.candidates file.  Use the -u option to import the
                candidates and current stats into the database.
                The server is now multi-threaded.  Multiple clients can
                connect at one time to get work.

Version 2.4.7:  December 2009 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  When a client connects, turn off buffering flags in case they
                were not reset before closing previous connection.
                Add support for pending_tests.html.
                Add sortoption to prpserver.ini to affect how tests are 
                handed out and how the candidates file is saved.
                Send GFN tests to client if PFGW, LLR, or phrot are configured
                and genefer80 had a round-off error.
    prpclient:  If all genefers had a round-off error with GFN test, use PFGW,
                LLR, or phrot.

Version 2.4.6:  November 2009 - Patch Release
          all:  Use select() on the socket before receiving.  On Linux (and
                only Linux), recv() will not return if there is nothing to
                be read from the socket.  select() can be configured to
                timeout if there is nothing to be received.  On all other OSs
                (Windows, Mac OS X, HP-UX, and Solaris) recv() return a 0
                if there is nothing to be received.
                Force close of socket if nothing is received.
     prpadmin:  Change order of includes to address builds on Unix.
                Fixed an error where messages from server would not print.
    prpserver:  Modified generic server stats to not list GFN divisors found.
                Added HTML classes for GFNs, Primorials, and Factorials

Version 2.4.5:  November 2009 - Patch Release
          all:  Fixed a crash that can occur when logging is turned on.  This
                was inadvertantly added in 2.4.4
                Modified handling of large messages since some OSs return the
                buffer size and some return the number of bytes read when
                receiving messages on a socket.
                Reduced socket timeout to 10 seconds.

Version 2.4.4:  November 2009 - Patch Release
          all:  Fixed a crash that occurs when large messages (> 1000 bytes)
                are received.
    prpserver:  Prevent server from double-checking primes.
                Output a message if unable to open one of the .removed files
                and keep candidate in the main file until the .removed file
                can be opened.  This addresses a potential crash in which the
                server presumed that the .removed could be opened. 

Version 2.4.3:  October 2009 - Official Patch Release
    prpclient:  Fixed a logging issue with the client to address potential
                segfaults.
                Fixed issue when loading workunits for GFN projects.
                Fixed issue with GFN testing that prevented client from choosing
                the correct executable for PRP tests.

Version 2.4.2:  October 2009 - Un-official Patch Release
          all:  Fixed a buffering issue with large messages.  This would normally
                affect prpadmin and prpserver, but could affect prpclient as well.
                Print error when unable to write to log.
    prpclient:  Output server version after getting work from the server.
                Fix issues with genefX64 that do not occur with genefer or genefer80.
                Fixed issue with validating helper programs.
                Fixed an issue where debuglevel=1 wouldn't log socket messages.
    prpserver:  Fixed a bug that causes the server to crash when it tries to
                add second tests for a candidate.
                Fixed a bug that causes the server to crash when configured for a
                Generalized Fermat Search.

Version 2.4.1:  October 2009 - Un-official Patch Release
    prpclient:  Fix issues with identifying versions of genefer that the client
                can run.
    prpserver:  Add an extra carriage return so HTML is correctly generated in
                browsers.
    
Version 2.4.0:  September 2009 - New Release
    prpserver:  When a client has established a new connection, send a
                message so that the client does not send any additional
                data until it receives that confirmation.
                Return immediately if the test is not found.  This addresses
                an issue where the server would log tests without residues.
                Send all responses for returned workunits in a single buffer
                to the client.  This eliminates synchronization issues
                between the client and server.
                Send "Acknowledge" message for each returned workunit.
                If the server loses its connection to the client in the
                middle of processing, it will terminate the connection
                immediately.  This should eliminate the appearance of the
                server "hanging" when that happens.
                Add additional debug information when expiring tests.
                Added support to search for Generalized Fermat Numbers (GFNs).
                Removed server_status.html.
    prpclient:  The client will wait for the server to tell that it has
                a connection before returning work.
                Send all returned workunits in a single buffer to the server
                and then wait for the server to return its messages.  This
                eliminates synchronization issues between the client and server.
                Look for "Acknowledge" message from server for each workunit
                before deleting the workunit.
                Tell server that the client has disconnected rather then using
                the generic "QUIT" message.
                This version no longer passes the -e argument to phrot.  It
                presumes that users have upgraded to phrot 0.71.
                Added support for GFN servers (and genefer software).

Version 2.3.0:  August 2009 - New Release
    prpserver:  Display count of primes by user on user_stats.html on pages
                where it was missing.
                Fixed an issue with Twin Prime servertype where it did not
                support certain ABC file formats.
    prpclient:  If PFGW fails with -a2, terminate the client.
                Pass idle flag to PFGW.  If idle=0, then the client will pass
                -N to PFGW, making run in normal priority.
                Delete the temp output file from PFGW so that when re-run
                with -a1 or -a2 that it doesn't find it and get caught in a loop.
                Fixed an issue with Twim Prime searches as client would
                always do -1 test even when +1 test was composite.
                Removed frequency= option.  The client will now complete all
                workunits before reporting to the server.

Version 2.2.6:  August 2009 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Fixed an issue that causes the client to hang when the
                server does not respond when the client is returning
                work to the server.

Version 2.2.5:  August 2009 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Fixed two issues where the client was accessing memory
                not available to it.  These would be triggered when
                the server rejects the test result or when the server
                no longer no longer has a record of the test.

Version 2.2.4:  August 2009 - Patch Release
          all:  Set timeout setting for reading from the socket to 30 
                seconds instead of 10 seconds.
    prpserver:  Corrected server_status.html page to show "Min N" in the
                appropriate column.
                Reject tests from the client if a residue is not provided.
                Added a required htmltitle= in the prpserver.ini file so that
                the server can provide a title for the generated HTML.
                Tell the browser to close the connection after the client
                closes the connection.  This addresses the browser "stalling"
                when someone requests one of the web pages.
    prpclient:  If the server does not respond before the timeout when returning
                workunits, the client will stop trying to send additional
                workunits so that it can remain in sync with the server.

Version 2.2.3:  June 2009 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  Add client ID to log files.
                Remove support for 1.x clients.
    prpclient:  Pass correct flag to PFGW for Primorial/Factorial primality tests.
                Set residue to PRIME when PFGW does primality test and number is prime.
                Delete save file if there are no work units.
                Use PFGW for non-base 2 numbers as v3.1 is faster than LLR and phrot.

Versino 2.2.2:  June 2009 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Fixed issue with restarting client where it would not handle some
                start options correctly.
                Modified log messages on the client when the server refuses the
                workunit.  In these cases the client will drop the workunit so that
                it can continue doing other work for the server.

Version 2.2.1:  June 2009 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  More changes to prpserver.delay to remove first test checks.  The
                server will no longer send the same test to two clients unless one
                of the client's has missed the expiration deadline.
    prpclient:  Fix a segfault if communication with the server is broken while
                sending workunits back.
                Fixed issue with counting of completed and current work units.
                The client will drop tests that are not known on the server.

Version 2.2.0:  June 2009 - New Release
    prpserver:  Add ability to expire tests (see prpserver.delay for information).
                Check for pending tests before removing candidates from the server.
                Add support for Twin Prime searches.
                Remove candidates after a successful test if there is no double-ckecking.
    prpclient:  Check for existence of workunit on server before sending rest of message.
                Add support for Twin Prime searches.
                Modularized code for the handling of helper programs.
                Do not return immediately when a prime/prp is found so that no tests
                are abandoned.
                Use -k feature added in PFGW 1.3.

Version 2.1.5:  May 2009 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  Do not give credit for abandoned tests.
                Use prpnet.ico for favicon.ico instead of prpnet.gif as some browsers
                do not support gifs.

Version 2.1.4:  May 2009 - Patch Release
    prpserver:  Return "End of Message" semaphore when the client has returns results
                that do not correspond to any tests on the server.

Version 2.1.3:  May 2009 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Add startoption and stopoption for use with automated clients.  Read
                the prpclient.ini file for more information
    prpserver:  Close the user_stats.ini file after saving.
                Fixed issue with user_stats.ini where score was not calculated
                correctly after a prime was found.
                Add prpnet.gif in response to favicon.ico request from browser.
                Various enhancements to user stats.

Version 2.1.2:  May 2009 - Official Release
    prpclient:  Fixed patch that addressed PFGW FFT rounding error as it completely
                borked the 2.1.1 client. 
                More changes for ^C handling to get Windows to work as I would expect
                it to work (which should be more like Unix).

Version 2.1.1:  May 2009 - Patch Release (beta)
    prpclient:  Fixed patch that addressed PFGW FFT rounding error as it completely
                borked the 2.1.0 client.
                Modified to skip lines in lresults.txt that are not related to
                the results of the test.

Version 2.1.0:  May 2009 - New Release (alpha)
    prpclient:  Modify handling of ^C with Visual Studio build used by Windows.
                After returning work, continue to read from socket until getting
                "End of Message" semaphore.
                Delete all temp files after returning results to the server.
                Capture FFT rounding errors from PFGW and re-issue test using -a option.
                Write servertype to save file so that workunits can be correctly handled
                upon restart of the client.
                When restarting the client, ask user what to do with workunits that have 
                been saved.
    prpserver:  Add user element to completed_tests.log.
                Look for correct return codes when sending e-mail using SMTP authentication.
                Replace %T format when calling strftime as Windows doesn't support it
                and will terminate application when it find it.
                Changed user stats structure hoping to eliminate stats collection issue.
                Send "End of Message" to client after receiving work done as a semaphore
                to the client to stop reading from the socket.
                Add Primes Found and GFN Divisors found to Fixed k/b/c server user stats HTML.

Version 2.0.4:  April 2009 - Official Release
    prpclient:  Change options for PFGW when finding GFNs to not do an unnecessary PRP test.
    
Version 2.0.3:  April 2009 - Patch Release (beta)
    prpclient:  Fix an issue where the client does not parse LLR test results correctly

Version 2.0.2:  April 2009 - Patch Release (beta)
    prpserver:  Log GFNs returned by the client
                Fix HTML generation as it would not respond in a timely fashion to the browser.
                Fix double close when loading from an ABC file.

Version 2.0.1:  April 2009 - Patch Release (beta)
          all:  Address issues with uninitialized variables when using Visual Studio.

Version 2.0.0:  April 2009 - New Release (alpha)
          all:  Add userid support which can be different than emailid.
                emailid is still required for uniqueness.
    prpadmin:   This gives an administrator access to the server to add new candidates (via 
                an ABC file) or remove candidates (via a factor log file) if factors have
                been found.
    prpserver:  Ingore SIGPIPE signal until I understand how to prevent that signal from being
                throw when I don't want it to be thrown.
                Verify that there are no duplicate candidate names after loading is complete,
                not during the loading process as it takes a very long time to load the
                server if there are a large number of candidates.
                Added a new stats engine.  This allows a web browser to call the server directly
                to get supported web pages.  More info can be found in readme.txt.
                Support SMTP verification and authentication for any mail the server sends.
                Added support for primorial and factorial server types.
                Removed master/slave logic as it isn't useful.
                Added support for prpadmin.
    prpclient:  Added "affinity=" option so that the client can tell LLR which CPU to use.
                When the client is terminated with a ^C, prompt the user as to what they want
                to do with workunits.
                Modified the client to use LLR for bases above 50 if it can choose between LLR
                and phrot.
                Fixed an issue where client performs tests again if not able to communicate with
                server.
                Added support for PFGW.  This means that the client can perform generic PRP and
                primality tests (whatever PFGW and prpserver can support).
                If PFGW is configured, that the client can do its own primality test if the
                first test was only a PRP test.
                If PFGW is configured, use it to test Proth primes for GFN divisibility.

Version 1.0.5:  January 2009 - Patch Release
          all:  Fixed an issue on Windows as Visual Studio does not initialize
                instance variables if they are not explicity initialized.
    prpclient:  Fixed an issue when loading from a save file where the number 
                of completed work units was not correctly updated.

Version 1.0.4:  January 2009 - Patch Release
          all:  Increase size of buffer for candidate names as 20 characters
                was not long enough.
    prpclient:  If there is only one workunit and it is inprogress, then do
                not communicate with the server.
                Write LLR primes to llr.prime and PRPs to llr.prp.
    prpserver:  Fixed a bug introduced with the Windows build that causes
                the server to not calculate the decimal length correctly.

Version 1.0.3:  January 2009 - Patch Release
          all:  Create .sln and .vcproj files for Microsoft Visual Studio.
                Modified Socket logic and defs.h to work with MS Visual Studio.
    prpclient:  Explicitly intialize some variables so that the Visual Studio
                build does not complain about them.
                Reset number of completed work units after getting new work.
                Put the erroneous client ID in the message that indicates that the
                client ID is invalid (instead of the e-mail ID).
    prpserver:  Send an INFO message instead of ERROR if the server does not find
                the candidate by name.  This will cause the results of the test to
                be lost, but will allow the client to continue processing other
                work units.  This behavior might be changed in the future.

Version 1.0.2:  January 2009 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  Send abandoned tests to the server so that the server knows when
                the client is not going to perform the test and can thus send a
                test to someone else.
                Fix an memory leak when maxworkunits is decreased to a value lower
                than the number of saved tests in the work*.save file.
                Allow setting of maxworkunits of 0 to complete any current incomplete
                test, send it to the server, then terminate the client.
                The next version of phrot can do a primality test for Proth numbers,
                so ensure that it is captured correctly and reported to the server.
    prpserver:  Fix an issue in Candidate.cpp where the number of successful tests
                performed was not incremented.
                When a successful test is returned, log the test in a file called
                completed_tests.log.
                The client can now indicated if a test has been abandoned.  If it
                has, then don't update the timestamp, but delete the test so that
                someone else can perform it.

Version 1.0.1:  December 2008 - Patch Release
    prpclient:  LLR output for base 2 tests differs from other bases, thus it has
                to be parsed differently.
                LLR for Proth numbers (k*2^n+1) performs a primality test, thus
                check for primality and report the number as prime instead of
                as a PRP.
    prpserver:  Check for numbers marked as Prime by LLR.

Version 1.0.0:  December 2008 - Initial Release
